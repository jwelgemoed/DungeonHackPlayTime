# DungeonHackPlayTime
A space for me to play around with Directx and 3d programming in general.
WARNING!! Here you will definitely not find clean code, pretty patterns or other nice things :)

This is as already stated above a simple project in which I try out different things that pique my interest. 

So this means that there are a ton of known issues that I will get to eventually, these include but are not limited to the following:
1) Shitty map editor. Yes, I know WPF (wtf more like it) - I've completely screwed up the implementation and idea behind WPF and MVVM. I started out wanting to test and play around with WPF - now I'm invested :( would probably have been better to stick with Windows Forms...
2) Need to sort out the sector / lineseg crap...
3) Collision detection - when walking into walls works for simple straight ahead movement, but goes seriously wrong sometimes. 

4) Switch to SharpDX - Slimdx does not have DirectX12 support and doesn't look like it's going to get it any time soon. SharpDX looks like a better option for future development.
